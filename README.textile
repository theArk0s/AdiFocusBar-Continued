This a simple, not configurable helper bar for hunter.

It displays a focus bar with a focus gain prediction.

It also displays a spell forecast for single target rotation. The rotations are freely inspired from "IcyVeins":http://www.icy-veins.com/ and "WarcraftHunterUnion":http://www.warcrafthuntersunion.com/.

The predictions take into account :

* focus boost from haste,
* focus gains from Viper Venom and Rapid Recuperation,
* Most talents : Fervor, Dire Beast, A Murder of Crows, Glaive Toss, Power Shot (but not Barrage).
* Pet spells : Rabid and Ancient Hysteria.

**This is still pretty much experimental. Don't complain if your DPS drops using this addon !**

Use /adifocusbar (or /adf) to open the option panel.
